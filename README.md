# NustalgiaApp-Latest
Latest version of Nustalgia App

Purpose:
  This app was created to help simplify the interview process for my business. In essence, I have started an interview company where I go to events and interact with the guests and ask them fun questions about the host we're celebrating.
  Because I work solo and want to minimize my editing time, I've created an app that helps me CLEARLY read a questions off my screen and navigate through them instead of trying to remember what question each guest wanted to do while I attempt to film and converse the guest.
  I have had issues right now with inputting a name to be used but that is something I am still figuring out.
  
 Major functions:
   1) Display question currently to ask CLEARLY and navigate through them.
   2) SOON: feature to customize the name, in app, of the host so hardcoding is no longer needed.
   3) SOON: feature to customize question and question selection.
